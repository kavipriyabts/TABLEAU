# TABLEAU
OVERVIEW:
  In this project, I explore the realm of Tableau by creating an interactive visualization using tableau's high-level features.
DATASET:
 I created this visulaization using kaggle's HR DATASET. First, I downloaded my dataset in kaggle platform and connected my data source in Tableau's data server using Ms-excel data server.
 one dataset contains several tables according to the data. In my dataset i have two tables such as sales table and HR table. Here I created relationships between two tables after connectiong to my data source.
WORKSHEETS:
 I create three worksheets using HR dataset.
  1. WORKSHEET_1 (EMPLOYEE DETAILS) - Here I used "SYMBOL MAPS" to represent my Employee details visualization.
  2. WORKSHEET_2 (CUSTOMER_DETAILS) - Here I used "TREE MAPS" to represent my Customer details visulaization.
  3. WROKSHEET_3 (SALES) - Here I used "HISTOGRAM" to represent my Sales details of my products over the years.
DASHBOARDS:
  Dashboard serves as the canvas for story telling process.
  DASHBOARD_1: I created as interactive dashboards by dragging my sheets from sheet pane onto the desired location on dashboard.
After organizing my worksheets, adding dashboard's interactive features such as filters, annotations that allowse users to exlpore the data and grasp the key insights easily.
STORY:
Araanging my sheets and dashboards on my story board. Tableau provides an 'story' feature to order my visualizations sequentially.
